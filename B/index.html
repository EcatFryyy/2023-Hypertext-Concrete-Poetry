                A misshapen creature of no particular age, sex, or condition, 
                chiefly remarkable for the violence of the sympathies and antipathies it excites in others, 
                itself without sentiment or emotion. There have been famous babes; 
                for example, little Moses, from whose adventure in the bulrushes the Egyptian hierophants of seven centuries 
                before doubtless derived their idle tale of the child Osiris being preserved on a floating lotus leaf.
