                The Devil's Dictionary was begun in a weekly paper in 1881, 
                and was continued in a desultory way at long intervals until 1906. 
                In that year a large part of it was published in covers with the title The Cynic's Word Book, 
                a name which the author had not the power to reject or happiness to approve. 
                To quote the publishers of the present work:  
                "This more reverent title had previously been forced upon him by the religious scruples of the last newspaper in which a part of the work had appeared, 
                with the natural consequence that when it came out in covers the country already had been flooded by its imitators with a score of 'cynic' booksâ€”The Cynic's This, 
                The Cynic's That, and The Cynic's t'Other. 
                Most of these books were merely stupid, 
                though some of them added the distinction of silliness. 
                Among them, they brought the word 'cynic' into disfavor so deep that any book bearing it was discredited in advance of publication."
